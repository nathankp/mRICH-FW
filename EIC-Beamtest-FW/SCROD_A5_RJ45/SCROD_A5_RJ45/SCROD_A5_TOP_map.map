Mapping design into LUTs...

   ULTI_CS.MEM_SELECT_I is not a recognized logical block. The mapper will
   continue to process the design but there may be design problems if this block
   does not get trimmed.
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2908 - The I/O component "SC_DC_CLK_N<0>" has an illegal IOSTANDARD
   value.  The IOB component is configured to use single-ended signaling and can
   not use differential IOSTANDARD value LVDS_25.  Two ways to rectify this
   issue are: 1) Change the IOSTANDARD value to a single-ended standard. 2)
   Correct the I/O connectivity by instantiating a differential I/O buffer.
