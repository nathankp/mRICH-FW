revise SCROD DC_Comm to use QBLink as communication protocol: 

####11/13/2018#########
Necessary Functionality:
1. Be able to talk to PC: 
	Messages:
	- send waveform data
	- readback scrod/dc register
	- send 'dead' if no DC response
	- recieve trigger from DC
	- send triggers to DC
	- send good event trigger to PC
	- Generate Output Register
2. Readout Daughtercard Data

Relationship with other Modules: 
1. DC_READOUT_DEMUX
   {Description: "Module starts readout command to daughter cards, module will either send raw data,  
   {pedestal subtracted data, pedestal calculated data, or save pedestal calculated data 
   {to SRAM depending on mode of operations." ***SRAM saving operation not available yet, lacking FW. 

	- Que's DC_COMM to readout DC: START_RD[4 DOWNTO 0] 
	- Que's DC_Comm to write to PC
	- Recieves 32-bit data word from DC_COMM: DC_FIFO_DOUT
	- Provides DC_COMM's WAVEF  ORM_FIFO DIN and control signals: WAVE_CLK, WAVEWR_EN,WAVE_RST
	- Reads TX_BUSY: If TargetX CTRL (is this what is meant by "TX module" in DEMUX?) is busy (e.g. being read out)
	- Reads FIFO empty status 
		- if FIFO is empty will enable readout 
		  of 8:32 DC_FIFO on DC_COMM: DC_FIFO_RD_EN
        - When DC sends no response, tells DC_COMM to send 'dead': NO_GO
2. ETH_MODULE: Transmits and recieves data to/from PC 
	- Send to PC: tx_udp_data, tx_udp_valid, tx_udp_ready
	- Recieve from PC: tx_udp_data, tx_udp_valid, tx_udp_ready(='1'), trx_udp_clock


DC_COMM FIFOs: 
1. DC_MAS_RX_FIFO_W1R8 : entity work.CMD_FIFO_w1r8
   PORT MAP (
    rst    => dc_fifo_reset,
    wr_clk => DATA_CLK,
    rd_clk => DATA_CLK,
    din    => dc_fifo_din(0 downto 0), 
    wr_en  => dc_fifo_wr_en,    
    rd_en  => '1',        
    dout   => w1r8_fifo_dout,            
    full   => open,   
    empty  => w18_fifo_empty);

2. DC_MAS_RX_FIFO_W8R32 : entity work.CMD_FIFO_w8r32
    PORT MAP (
    rst    => dc_fifo_reset,
    wr_clk => DATA_CLK,
    rd_clk => CLK,
    din    => w1r8_fifo_dout,
    wr_en  => dc_wr_en(2),
    rd_en  => DC_FIFO_RD_EN,
    dout   => DC_FIFO_DOUT,
    full   => open,
    empty  => DC_FIFO_EMPTY);

3. DC_REG_FIFO_W1R8 : entity work.CMD_FIFO_w1r8
   PORT MAP (
    rst    => dc_fifo_reset,
    wr_clk => DATA_CLK,
    rd_clk => udp_usr_clk,
    din    => dc_fifo_din(0 downto 0), 
    wr_en  => dc_fifo_wr_en,    
    rd_en  => dc_reg_rd_en,        
    dout   => dc_reg_dout,            
    full   => open,   
    empty  => dc_reg_empty);
 
 4. REG_READ_BACK_FIFO : entity work.STATE_FIFO
    PORT MAP (
     rst    => reg_fifo_rst,
     wr_clk => udp_usr_clk,
     rd_clk => udp_usr_clk,
     din    => reg_fifo_din,
     wr_en  => reg_fifo_wr_en,
     rd_en  => reg_fifo_rd_en,
     dout   => reg_fifo_dout,
     full   => open,
     empty  => reg_fifo_empty);

- Sending_data process: PC passes cmd to SCROD or dc 
	state: load_data: 
		- checks dc_num: 
			if x"0" then SCROD CMD
				OUTPUT REG WRITTEN HERE
			else
				loads rx_fifo_data_out(MSB) onto internal_data_out
				goes to send_data state: serially shifts out data to DC: tx_mask(3 DOWNTO 0) (DC #) AND (internal_data_out & internal_data_out & internal_data_out & internal_data_out)
					- bitwise AND of DC# and vector of all internal_data_out
			
 
		Revised load_data:
			if dc_num = x"0" then
				cmd_type    <= rx_fifo_data_out(27 downto 24);
				scrod_reg   <= rx_fifo_data_out(23 downto 16);
				reg_data    <= rx_fifo_data_out(15 downto 0);
				scrod_dc_st <= cmd_check;
			else
				dc_cmd <= rx_fifo_data_out; --load rx_fifo_data_out onto QBLink input 
				start_send <= '1'; --QBLink LocalWordInValid ='1'
			end if;

       state: send_data: 
       		scrod_dc_sta <= 10;
			internal_tx <= '1';
			reg_rb_en <= '0';
			if readout = '1' then
				internal_data_out <= rd_out_cmd(bit_count);
			else
				internal_data_out <= rx_fifo_data_out(bit_count);
			end if;
			if bit_count /= 0 then
				bit_count    <= bit_count - 1;
				scrod_dc_st  <= send_data;
			else
				scrod_dc_st <= done;
			end if;

		Revised send_data:
			-- find out how many clock cycles are required for QBLink transmission
			if QBLink finished: start_send <='0'

*Building block diagram of my understanding of the desired communication system*
**Building block diagram of existing communication system**

*SCROD Recieving data:
	- which DC when? 
	- QBLink will not be outputting recieved word until localWordOutRq is '1'; 

- Testbench QBLink:
	- rawserialout continuously outputs a sequence even without a localWordIn and localWordInValid ='1'. 
        - localWordInvalid and localWordOutValid are enables to Receiving FIFOs of the DC_Comm and DataCollection respectively

###11/20/2018###
- SCROD Revised BLK Diagram:
  1. DC_Comm:
     *Handles all communication with the Daughtercards (writng and reading). Takes in commands from the Commander Interpreter (CI), outputs data     
     *to the Data Collector (DatCol). 	
     INPUTS: Data Clock (25 MHz), serial data from DCs [7:0], command from CI [31:0], command to start writing from CI [3:0], reset,
	        command to start data readout from CI.
	
     OUTPUTS: command bit to DCs [7:0], DC_data to DatCol, command to recieve data to DatCol,
              (status bit) trigger link synced [7:0], (status bit) serial clock locked [7:0], Busy signal to CI and DatCol, No response from DC Flag [7:0] to CI 

	*add timing module to flag busy and dead DCs 

  2. DataCollector:
     *Stores event data from DC, processes data to get waveform, pedestal subtracted, or pedestal calculated data. Save pedestal calculated data     
     * to SRAM onboard SCROD. Will readout data one D.C. at time (?)
     INPUTS: FPGA Clock (125 MHz), command to recieve data from DC_Comm, Command to process data [3:0] (Waveform, pedestal...) from CI, Command to start sending data from CI, 
             Command to save data to SRAM (Ignore for now), Fix window [8:0],reset

     OUTPUTS: Waveform Data to CI, other data to CI, pedestal calc data to SRAM

  3. Command Interpreter: 
     *Translates PC commands from Ethernet Interface (EI) to DatCol and DC_Comm
     INPUTS: command from PC (rx_udp_data[7:0]), rx_udp_valid from EI, tx_udp_ready from EI, Waveform data from DatCol to be written to PC, other data to be written to PC from DatCol, 
             UDP clock from EI, DC_Comm busy signal, No Response Flag from DC [7:0].  
     
     OUTPUTS: DC command to DC_Comm, DC_Comm start writing command [7:0], start data readout to DC_Comm [7:8], Data process command to DatCol [3:0], Send Data to PC command to DatCol, 
              Save data to SRAM command to DatCol, tx_udp_data to EI, tx_udp_valid to EI, rx_udp_ready to EI.   

  4. Ethernet Interface
     *intefaces Command Interperter (CMD_INT) to PC
     INPUTS: ext_user_clk (FPGA Clock?), tx_udp_data from CMD_INT, tx_udp_valid from CMD_INT, rx_udp_ready from CMD_INT, mgttxfault, mgtmod0, mgtlos, mgtrxp , mgtrxn, mgtclk1p, mgtxlk1n. 

     OUTPUTS: tx_udp_ready to CMD_INT, rx_udp_data to CMD_INT, rx_udp_valid to CMD_INT, trx_udp_clock to CMD_INT, mgttxdis, mgtmod2, mgtmod1, mgttxp, mgttxn 

Questions for Gary:
1.*** Does ETH Module run on same FPGA clock?**** (will be rewritten ignore for now).
2. How does 8 bit rx_udp_data get converted to 32-bit dc_cmd? FIFO? (ignore)
3. Does Data Collector receive data from DCs sequentially or in parallel? 
4. Should there be separate signals for waveform data, pedestal sub, pedestal calc, ect.?
5. ***FIFO for read out data in CMD_INT?***will see if it is necessary, try to have DC and SCROD talk with FW containing minimal code to support QBLink

1.In QBLink s6SerialInterfaceIn: has an align input, not shown on BLK diagram
2. trgLinkSynced not in BLK? (answered)
3. How to properly start QBLink?
	- to start using QBLink the bytelink submodule must pass the training state:
		- INSIDE TRAINING STATE:
			+ txdata8b is set to k_COM_align_C (it is then encoded and sent out hence the serial output sequence you see constantly going.)
			+ there is an alignment counter alignCnt which must increment for ALIGN_CYCLES_G in order to set trgLinkSynced = '1' and move onto to the next state
			+ the count is reset back to zero if at least one of 4 conditions arise. One of these being that rxDataByte is neither K_COM_ALIGN_C nor K_COM_ZERO_C.
				!ISSUE: rxdatabyte is the wrong value! 
				--> rxdatabyte is the output of the 10b to 8b decoder. Decoder input is inputRxData10b, which is updated by rxData10b (from S6SerialInterfaceIn module) every rising data_clk edge
				--> FIRST: rxData10b is all 0's since no incoming serial data. rxdatabyte is also 0. 
				--> after two data_clk CCs rxdatabyte become "01011111" despite rawserialin and rxdata10b remaining at 0
			
###12/04/2018###

 				--> SOLUTION: HAVE A TRAINING partner: instatiate another QBLink module to communicate with.
				~QBLink TB is in ~\Desktop\QBLink\QBLink\QBLink_TB.vhd
Communication test sequence:
-->SCROD sends testdata to testbench DC 
--> DC reads back to SCROD, when DClocalwordout = DEADBEEF;

- will write DC module and create testbench with both projects.

1. When do we want DC to read to SCROD? Should there be a special command for the SCROD to internally set localWordOutReq <= '1'? same for rst, localword in? Direct signal from SCROD or internally controlled? 
2. How do I create an error condition for QBLink? rxCodeErr = '1' or rxDispErr = '1';

meeting update: 
	- finished writing SCRODQBLink
	- testbench was not working so I studied QBLink more
	- learned I had to have a training partner to get past TRAINING_STATE
	- had a successful testbench
	- working on preparing HMB_DC
